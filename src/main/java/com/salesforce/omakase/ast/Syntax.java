/**
 * A distinct unit of syntax within CSS.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Syntax} objects are used to represent the individual pieces of content of the parsed CSS source, and are the
 * primary objects used to construct the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). Not all {@link Syntax} objects have content
 * directly associated with them. Some are used to represent the logical grouping of content, such as the {@link Rule}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each unit has a particular line and column indicating where it was parsed within the source.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It's important to remember that <em>unrefined</em> Syntax objects, unless validation is performed, may actually
 * contain invalid CSS. Simply refining the syntax unit will verify it's grammatical compliance, which can be coupled
 * with (linting?) to ensure correct usage.
