Quick Start For Dev Contributions
=================================

This is a quick summary of everything you need to do if you intend to work on this project:

- Carefully go through the readme.md file, *especially* everything under [Development and Contribution](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/nmcwilliams/omakase#development-and-contribution).
    - Make sure you have all of the right tools installed
    - do a quick build from terminal (mvn clean install)
- If you haven't read the above, stop now and go read it.
- Check out idea/readme.md if you are using IntelliJ (nearly mandatory for any meaningful contribution).
- Alternatively if you are using eclipse, you may notice an eclipse/readme.md, however that file and everything under that folder is out of date. See the above point.
- Check out deploy.md if you need to push changes (jars) to be consumed by aura, aura open source and sfdc.
- You can do some quick testing using the omakase CLI (see the readme) or playing around with Debug.java
